# Rarity-Sniper

This Repo shows off a project that I have spent many hours on rather than for public use. This program is used to rate NFT projects by their rarity to determine the rarest tokens. The results I get are extremely accurate compared to official tools such as raritysniper. I have been trying to account for a couple of issues for each different way the developers of the intended NFT contract will release their metadata on reveal. 


This was the first big solo project that I have worked on. I started this with only an end goal with no idea how to get there. I learned many things from this journey, such as more about Web3, how to read and understand Solidity, and how to better write code that can change on the fly.
